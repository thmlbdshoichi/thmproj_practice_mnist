# My Pratice on Convolutional Neural Network
Hey, MNIST Dataset is probably anyone first pratice on Neural Network Project
I did it long time ago and decide to refactor - recode my own work a little bit and push it on github
Hope it would give anyone some idea on how to create a model, train, test, data visualization using seaborn :)
