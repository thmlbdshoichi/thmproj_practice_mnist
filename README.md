# My Pratice on Convolutional Neural Network
Hey, MNIST Dataset is probably anyone first pratice on Neural Network Project
I also did it long time ago (Probably 2-3 years ago :)
Now, it's 8/2022 I want to review my knowledge about Deep Learning
so I decide to refactor - recode my own work a little bit and push it on github
Hope it would give anyone some idea on how to create a model, train, test, data visualization using seaborn :)
